# Personal Assistant Bot

This project is a personal assistant bot that converts any fuzzy user input (e.g., “Need a sunset-view table for two tonight; gluten-free menu a must”) into a structured JSON response.  
It identifies the intent category, key entities, confidence score, and suggests follow-up questions if information is missing or ambiguous.

The backend API is built using Python, and the frontend UI is built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Categorizes user requests into intent categories (dining, travel, gifting, etc.)
- Extracts key entities (date, time, location, etc.)
- Provides confidence scores for categorization
- Suggests follow-up questions for missing information
- Web search capability for non-standard requests
